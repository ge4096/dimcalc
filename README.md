DimCalc
=======

What is DimCalc?
----------------
DimCalc is a terminal-based application written in Python 3 that allows for calculations involving units.

So what can I do with it?
-------------------------

DimCalc accepts input like pretty much any other text-based calculator program, so

'''
> 1+1
2
'''

and

'''
> 4*(3+2.5)^2-11
110
'''

What makes DimCalc unique, though, is the fact that any number in a calcuation can have a unit attached to it, so

'''
> 1m+1m
2m
'''

and

'''
> 4Pa*(3m+2.5m)^2-11N
110.0N
'''
